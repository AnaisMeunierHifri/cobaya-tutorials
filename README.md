# Cobaya Tutorials

Welcome to the **Cobaya Tutorials** repository! This repository contains a series of tutorials in the form of `jupyter notebooks` designed to help users understand how cosmological inference works and effectively learn and use [Cobaya](https://pypi.org/project/cobaya/) (Cosmological Bayesian Analysis), a powerful tool for cosmological parameter estimation and model testing.

## Overview

`Cobaya` is a Python-based framework for cosmological parameter estimation and model comparison. These tutorials provide step-by-step guidance on using Cobaya to perform various types of cosmological analyses. Whether you're new to cosmological analysis or looking to refine your skills with `Cobaya`, these tutorials will help you keeping your skills up to date.

## Features

- **Introduction to Cobaya**: Basic concepts and setup.
- **Data Preparation**: How to prepare and format your data for analysis.
- **Model Setup**: Setting up and customizing cosmological models.
- **Running Analyses**: How to execute analyses and interpret results.
- **Advanced Topics**: In-depth tutorials on more complex features and use cases.

## Installation

- **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gcanasherrera/cobaya-tutorials.git
   cd cobaya-tutorials```


### Requirements:
python3, latest [cobaya](https://pypi.org/project/cobaya/) version and cosmology dependencies.
We recommend running the notebooks in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com).
